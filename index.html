<div class="homebox">
  <p>I recently received my AS in software development from Ivy Tech Community College and I currently attend 
   <br/>Indiana-Purdue University Fort Wayne, looking to get my bachelors in computer science. I am highly 
   <br/>self-motivated and eager to get employed in a position where I can test my skills and further my growth 
   <br/>as a software engineer.</p>
